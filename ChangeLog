zerobuild (alpha)
    Parser: now global includes can be defined at the beginning of the sources list.
    The whole project gets rebuild if a global include file was modified!
    This is how it looks like:

------------ snip -----
    # zerobuild makefile

[executable, name = zerobuild]
sources = global.h, parser.c, make.c, process.c

ccompiler = clang-3.9
------------ snip -----
